      <p>syncplay eSports est fier d'annoncer notre tournoi inaugural 2v2 EA Sports FC 26, qui débutera le 20 décembre 2025 ! Cet événement historique marque le début de la scène eSports compétitive de syncplay avec une cagnotte exclusive réservée aux équipes inscrites !</p>
      
      <p>C'est plus qu'un simple tournoi—c'est la fondation de quelque chose de spécial. Nous rassemblons les meilleurs joueurs eFootball pour concourir dans un format d'équipe passionnant qui testera la stratégie, la coordination et les compétences comme jamais auparavant.</p>
      
      <h3>Détails du Tournoi</h3>
      
      <p><strong>Date :</strong> 20 décembre 2025<br/>
      <strong>Heure :</strong> 15h00 UTC<br/>
      <strong>Format :</strong> Compétition par Équipe 2v2<br/>
      <strong>Équipes :</strong> 32 Équipes (64 Joueurs)<br/>
      <strong>Cagnotte :</strong> Récompenses exclusives pour les équipes inscrites<br/>
